## Installation.
The ```requirements_all_code.txt``` file provides the necessary packages for SimBank and all experiments. The ```SimBank/requirements.txt``` file provides the necessary packages for SimBank only.
All code was written for ```python 3.11.5```.

## SimBank
The complete SimBank simulator can be found in the ```SimBank/``` folder. The file SimBank_Generator_Guide.ipynb contains a full walkthrough on how to use SimBank to create offline datasets and allow online training for each intervention, to vary the confounding level, and to evaluate method policies.

## Experiments of the paper
Download the data for the experiments from [OneDrive](https://kuleuven-my.sharepoint.com/:f:/g/personal/jakob_demoor_kuleuven_be/EuhF_qPmUGNKkR30eWVxENgBnflVca5sWTIdhrLa46d4Fw?e=ZassYK). 

Put the data in the ```data/``` folder. Now, the results from the paper can be reproduced by setting the ```path``` variable in the config/config.py file to your directory and running the appropriate script.
